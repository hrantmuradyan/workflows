# Workflows

This repo houses reusable workflows for TBOL. You should _really_ be using these instead of creating your own. If these don't work for you, please help us make these workflows better by contributing. The goal is to standardize our CI processes so that spinning up new apps is easier, we can easily push out changes to workflows, and the experience is consistent across all of our repos.
